    # Mocking LLM/Agent is hard without full setup.
    # Instead, let's try to run the server logic directly if possible, or just restart and check logs.
    # But since I can't see the logs, I'll try to use the 'run_command' to start the server in blocking mode (shortly) or use 'read_terminal' on the OLDER process.
    pass

# Better idea: Read the log file if it exists, or the stdout of the process using command_status.
